USEFUL COMMANDS
  Run All Feature Specs
      rake test:integration METER_ENV=test


FEATURE SPECS
  Found under spec/features
  These are simple integration specs testing core functionality of each componenet.

  Uses MiniTest (not RSpec)
  ** Beware of differences (notably before(:all) variations do not work with MiniTest) **

  Commands:
     Run All Specs:
       rake test:integration METER_ENV=test

     The task is found under: spec/tasks/test.rake

  Configuration:
    use config/vsphere.yml
    set the "test:" block

    should set to:
      host: 'vcn16.dev.ral.6fusion.com'
      log_level: debug # For Vsphere Output

  Notes:
    VSphere Setup Dependency:
      The tests are dependent on vcn16.dev.ral.6fusion.com for now.
      There doesn't seem to be a way to provision data centers and hosts,
      So, we need to manually create this data center.

    Test Setup:
      VMs are created using: create_vm(<name>,<data_center>)
      And destroyed using: destroy_vm(<name>,<data_center>)
      These methods are found in spec/support/vsphere_helpers.rb

      ** Beware **
      before(:all), before(:suite) do NOT work as expected
      All MiniTest before block variations run before EACH test

      So, must combine tests into one
      Or, can use begin / rescue within individual test for unique setup/teardown
      Most of the features tests combine expectations into one block to avoid hitting VSphere
      for each individual expectation.
